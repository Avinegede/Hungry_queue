Our website is designed to help customers know how many people are ahead of them in line before they receive their food. Customers simply enter their name or order number and the website displays the number of people ahead of them and an estimated wait time. This helps customers plan their time and feel more confident that they will receive their food in a timely manner. Once their order is ready, the website will notify them to pick up their food.
